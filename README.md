# Memory Card Game Project

How the game works:
The game has eight pairs of identical cards that are shuffled every time. Once the player starts playing a timer starts running and a counter is recording how many moves are made. After all cards are matched the game is over and a popup message shows up informing the  player of their rating based on how many moves they made and the total time they played.

# How to play:

1) Click on a card and memorise it

2) Match all the identical cards into pairs

3) See your rating, time and moves at the score panel

4) Hit the restart button if you want to play again!

# Coding the project:

I've used HTML and CSS to create and style the web page while Javascript was used to add functionality to the game and make it interactive.
To begin with the stack of cards was created while the shuffling of the cards function is from the starter code and can be found in detail in the recourses.
Then the timer and counter were coded so a player's moves and time are recorded.
Also animations were added so the cards opened, closed, matched and unmatched in a specific way.
Lastly the popup message was added so the player's rating, moves and time are displayed and they have the choice to restart the game.
